# Exercise 003: Add all elements in array

The purpose of this exercise is to verify that you know how to create and iterate through arrays.

## Description

### Java

1. Create a package called `exercises` and inside that a subpackage called `java`.
1. In the `java` package create a class called `Exercise3`.
1. In the `Exercise3` class insert a `main()` method.
1. In the `main()` method, create an array variable named `numbers` of type `int`. Set 5 initial values in the array.
1. Create another variable named `sum` of type `int` and set its initial value to `0`.
1. Loop through the `numbers` array and add all elements to `sum`.
1. Print out the value of `sum` after the loop.
