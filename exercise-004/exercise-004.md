# Exercise 004: Sum numbers from array of data objects

The purpose of this exercise is to verify that you know how to create classes, how to create instance variables inside the classes, how to create an array of objects and how to iterate that array while referencing the objects in it.

## Description

### Java

1. Create a package called `exercises` and inside that a subpackage called `java`.
1. In the `java` package create a class called `DataObject`.
1. Inside the `DataObject` class create a `public` member variable called `count` of type `int`.
1. In the `java` package create a class called `Exercise3`.
1. In the `Exercise3` class insert a `main()` method.
1. Inside the `main()` method create an array of `DataObject`.
1. Create 3 `DataObject` instances and assign a reference of them to element `0`,`1` and `2` in the array.
1. Inside the `main()` method create a `sum` variable of type `int`.
1. Loop through the array and add all `count` member variable values of the `DataObject` instances to the `sum` variable.
1. Inside the `main()` method, print out the value of the `sum` variable.

### C&#35;

1. Create a namespace called `Exercises` and inside that a namespace called `CSharp`.
1. In the `CSharp` namespace create a class called `DataObject`.
1. Inside the `DataObject` class create a `public` member variable called `Count` of type `int`.
1. In the `CSharp` namespace create a class called `Exercise3`.
1. In the `Exercise3` class insert a `Main()` method.
1. Inside the `Main()` method create an array of `DataObject`.
1. Create 3 `DataObject` instances and assign a reference of them to element `0`,`1` and `2` in the array.
1. Inside the `Main()` method create a `sum` variable of type `int`.
1. Loop through the array and add all `Count` member variable values of the `DataObject` instance references to the `sum` variable.
1. Inside the `Main()` method, print out the value of the `sum` variable.
