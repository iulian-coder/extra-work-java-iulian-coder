# Extra practice and worklog

If you are reading this, it means that you want some extra practice to get better in programming and in OOP. This repo is where you can store all the exercises you are going to do, and here you can write a log about what you have accomplished.

## Simple rules

There are some rules that you need to keep in order to make the practice transparent for mentors and yourself.

1. You must have at least **2** meaningful commits per day in this repo. 
   - Use proper commit messages
   - The 2 commits should contain code.
   - If you update the worklog in a separate commit, it does not count towards the 2 commits / day rate. But of course, you can update the worklog while pushing code to the repo.
   - Please try to minimalize the amount of large commits when you push more than a few files at once. Prefer atomic commits when you can.
1. Start with the included exercises. You are free to add more later on.
   - When you include exercises, use the exercise template folder for starting a new project and provide proper task description in the folder.
1. Write daily worklog of your practice in a separate `.md` file, eg. `worklog.md`.
   - Use the worklog template, copy it for every day and fill in the hours/links/text for the day.
   - There is an example worklog for 2 days, you can see clearly what to change each day.
   - The closing line is part of the worklog template so copy it, too.


## Worklog template 

**Year-Month-Day, Day of week**

I want to get better understanding of programming so I spent **X** hours with practice today. The sum of my overall work is **N+X** hours now. 

My main goal for today was: **a sentence describing my goal.**

These are the tasks I did today to achieve my goal:

- Task 1 description text. It can be a long sentence or a couple of lines if it is complex.
- Task 2 description text. It can be a long sentence or a couple of lines if it is complex.
- Task N description text. It can be a long sentence or a couple of lines if it is complex.

These are the links I studied today to achieve my goal:

- [Description of link 1](http://the-link-itself.com) - Description of how it helped me
- [Description of link 2](http://the-link-itself.com) - Description of how it helped me
- [Description of link N](http://the-link-itself.com) - Description of how it helped me

**2048-04-16, Sunday**

I want to get better understanding of programming so I spent **2** hours with practice today. The sum of my overall work is **2** hours now. 

My main goal for today was: **to create a base repo for extra practice.**

These are the tasks I did today to achieve my goal:

- Created a new git repo in my Github profile. I set it to be private to be able to work on it freely without spoilering solutions to anyone.
- Updated the simple gitignore with more advanced exclusions

These are the links I studied today to achieve my goal:

- [An automated tool for creating beautiful gitignore files](https://www.gitignore.io/) - I used it to generate a gitignore file
- [Cheatsheet to Github's markdown syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) - I did not know how to create clickable links in markdown, now I can :)

**2048-04-17, Monday**

I want to get better understanding of programming so I spent **3** hours with practice today. The sum of my overall work is **5** hours now. 

My main goal for today was: **to include some predefined exercises in the repo.**

These are the tasks I did today to achieve my goal:

- Planned what kind of tasks to include in the repos as a start.
- Created a couple of extra tasks in separate directories.
- Shown the repo to mentors to ask for their opinions

These are the links I studied today to achieve my goal:

- [The homepage of our curriculum](https://codecool.gitlab.io/codecool-curriculum/#/) - I browsed the previous assignments for inspiration and found some great links
- [Java OOP exercises](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/J3f_OOPExercises.html) - I find this site really useful for practice, there are tons of well defined tasks
- [A few basic Java exercises](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java/exercises.html) - These tasks are simple but are good for a start. Solutions are also included, pssst.
